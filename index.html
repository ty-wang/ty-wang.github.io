              <p style="text-align:justify">Snake robots can locomote through tightly packed spaces, but turning effectively within unmodelled and unsensed environments remains challenging. Inspired by a behavior observed in the nematode <em>C. elegans</em>, we propose a novel in-place turning gait for elongated limbless robots. To simplify the control of the robots' many internal degrees-of-freedom, we introduce a biologically-inspired template in which two traveling waves are superposed in the same plane, producing an in-plane turning motion. We call this gait an <em>omega turn</em>. The omega turn gait arises from modulating the wavelengths and amplitudes of the two traveling waves. We experimentally test the omega turn on a snake robot, and show that this turning gait outperforms previous turning gaits: it results in a larger angular displacement and a smaller area swept by the body over a gait cycle, allowing the robot to turn in narrower spaces.

              <p style="text-align:justify">Sidewinder rattlesnakes generate movement through coordinated lateral and vertical traveling waves of body curvature. Previous biological and robotic studies have demonstrated that proper control and coordination of these two waves enables robust and versatile locomotion in complex environments. However, the propagation of the vertical wave, which sets the body-environment contact state, can affect static stability and cause undesirable locomotion behaviors, especially when for movement at low speeds. Here, we propose to stabilize gaits by modulations of the spatial frequency of the vertical wave, which can be used to tune the number of distinct body-environment contact patches (while maintaining a constant overall contact area). These modulations act to stabilize configurations that were previously statically unstable and therefore, by eliminating dynamic effects such as undesired turning, broaden the range of movements and behaviors accessible to limbless locomotors at a variety of speeds. Specifically, our approach identifies, for a given lateral wave, the spatial frequency of the vertical wave that statically stabilizes the locomotor and then uses geometric mechanics tools to identify the coordination (i.e., the phase shift) between the vertical and lateral waves that produces a desired motion. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique on the locomotion of both robotic and robophysical systems.</p>

              <p style="text-align:justify">Snake robots have the potential to maneuver through tightly packed and complex environments. One challenge in enabling them to do so is the complexity in determining how to coordinate their many degrees-of-freedom to create purposeful motion. This is especially true in the types of terrains considered in this work: environments full of unmodeled features that even the best of maps would not capture, motivating us to develop closed-loop controls to react to those features. To accomplish this, this work uses proprioceptive sensing, mainly the force information measured by the snake robotâ€™s joints, to react to unmodeled terrain. We introduce a biologically-inspired strategy called directional compliance which modulates the effective stiffness of the robot so that it conforms to the terrain in some directions and resists in others. We present a dynamical system that switches between modes of locomotion to handle situations in which the robot gets wedged or stuck. This approach enables the snake robot to reliably traverse a planar peg array and an outdoor three-dimensional pile of rocks.</p>

              <p style="text-align:justify">Soft pneumatic network (pneu-net) actuators are widely employed for achieving sophisticated motions. However, to produce bending and twisting simultaneously in a single pneu-net actuator is challenging. In this paper we present a programmable design to enable pneu-net actuators to achieve such complex motions. This achievement is mainly owing to tuning a structure parameter, the chamber angle. Through finite element analysis and experimental verification, variation trends of bending and twisting motions with respect to the chamber angle are investigated. Additionally, deformation characteristics of actuators are demonstrated by depicting configurations of actuators and some grasping tests. By adjusting the chamber angle, the motion of pneu-net actuators is explored into 3D space and becomes more sophisticated and dexterous. This programmable design method guides the design of pneu-net actuators, making them promising candidates for more complicated and advanced applications.</p>

Equations of motion, frictions, and contacts are modeled link-wise, and then combined to full dynamics of the whole articulated system. Partial feedback linearization method is used in the controller design to achieve varying gaits for reasonable movements of the snake robot. Reliability of the model and effectiveness of the controller are validated in demos, which enable a broader area for control strategy development in snake robots.</p>

              <p style="text-align:justify">Traditional controllers, such as the linear quadratic regulator, perform well on many systems; however, if the dynamics of the system are nonlinear, such a control strategy is not globally optimal. If the system state is perturbed sufficiently far from the desired state, control can be poor, or worse yet, the system can become unstable. In contrast, neural networks trained via reinforcement learning (RL) can approximate globally-optimal policies for highly nonlinear systems. Once the neural network is trained, computation of the policy is efficient, making them well-suited to real-time control. The primary drawbacks to RL policies is the heavy computational burden during training, and the fact that training does not always converge to a good policy. We propose a novel, hybrid controller design which combines the output of a PD controller and a neural network to help mitigate these issues. We demonstrate greatly improved learning stability compared to a pure neural network, trained to control a compass gait walker on rough terrain. We also demonstrate the ability of the hybrid-controlled walker to walk larger distances successfully compared to either a PD-controlled or pure neural network-controlled walker.</p>

              <p style="text-align:justify">Although state-of-the-art visual odometry algorithms have shown excellent performance in modern SLAM systems, they still suffer from heavy parameter tuning processes while being implemented in completely new environments. Deep learning based visual odometry has been seen as a candidate for solving this problem and adding accuracy and robustness to visual odometry modules in SLAM systems. In this project we make a comparison of an end-to-end deep learning based visual odometry with a traditional geometry based visual odometry in ORB-SLAM pipeline. DeepVO leverages the advantages of CNNs and RNNs on image processing and neighbouring information co-relating. It has the advantage of only using raw RGB images as input without any other carefully tuned parameters, such as camera calibration. While the visual odometry of ORB-SLAM2 uses corner detector to extract features for bag of words method, then it applies camera calibration and careful parameter tuning for pose estimation. By testing both visual odometry module in ORB-SLAM system and the deep learning based visual odometry algorithm on KITTI dataset, we found that the deep learning based visual odometry still cannot outperform the conventional visual odometry methods. But we believe that the deep learning based visual odometry can be used as a good complementary of the conventional methods to improve its robustness in different environments.</p>
